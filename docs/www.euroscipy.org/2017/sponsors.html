<a "href=https://www.numfocus.org"> NumFOCUS </a>
is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that supports and promotes world-class, innovative,
open source scientific computing.

</br>
</br>
Our Mission
</br>
The mission of NumFOCUS is to promote sustainable high-level programming languages, open code development, and reproducible scientific research. We accomplish this mission through our educational programs and events as well as through fiscal sponsorship of open source data science projects. We aim to increase collaboration and communication within the scientific computing community.

</br>
</br>
How We Support Open Source
</br>
Most individual projects, even the wildly successful ones, find the overhead of a non-profit to be too large for their community to bear. NumFOCUS provides a critical service as an umbrella organization which removes the burden from the projects themselves to raise money. NumFOCUS aims to ensure that money is available to keep projects in the scientific data stack funded and available. So if you find value in these tools and have always wanted to give back, donating to NumFOCUS gives you a way of supporting either a specific project of your choice or all of our great initiatives at once!NumFOCUS has received 501(c)3 status as a public charity in the United States.
