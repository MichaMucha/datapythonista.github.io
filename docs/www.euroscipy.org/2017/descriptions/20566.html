    <h3>Are you performing experiments? Then structure your data as late as possible.</h3>
    
    <h1>Problem</h1>
<p>Imagine you perform some experiments, be it lab experiments, business studies or algorithm benchmarking. You will probably manipulate a number of <em>factors</em> and record the outcome of the experiment for particular factor <em>combinations</em>.</p>
<p>So how would you store these results? My naive solution was to create a <code>dict</code> of a <code>dict</code> of a <code>dict</code> ... and so on, especially since Python offers a great support for <code>dict</code>s. And I would store the results in a pickle file.</p>
<p>However, I noticed that this is leads to very brittle structures. You often have to change factor names or combination types as you go. This leads a lot of Russian dolls of <code>dict</code>s that are incompatible with each other. And the most annoying thing is the churn in the data-producing code as well as in the data-postprocessing code (e.g. visualisation).</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>The solution is, in hindsight, really simple: Structure your data as late as possible. The data-producing code should record data in the Pandas' <em>long format</em>. Then you are free to change the <em>factors</em> and <em>factor combinations</em> as you wish, the data-producing code stays the same. You now only have to change the data-postprocessing code.</p>
<h1>Talk overview</h1>
<p>In this talk, I will show a simple example of algorithm benchmarking. I will demonstrate how rigid structures get repeatedly broken over time and how one can alleviate this problem by using Pandas' long format. I will also present a short overview of relevant Pandas functions.</p>
<h1>References</h1>
<p>In a way, my call for late structuring resonates with <a href="http://degoes.net/articles/kill-data">this</a> blog post.</p>
