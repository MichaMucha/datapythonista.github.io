    <h1>How to not screw up with machine learning in production (and more about engineering in data science)</h1>
<p>Machine learning is on a way to wide adoption, but getting it right is more of an art than a science yet. This is also true for the last part of data science pipeline - getting trained model with suitable performance out to the world to make valuable predictions.</p>
<p>Many of data science teams, being pressured by deadlines, follow the path of least resistance - wrapping their model into Flask web service and exposing it online. This results in strong coupling of machine learning models with other components and makes changes and experimentation costly.</p>
<p>There is need to allow small teams working on ML problems to easily try new ideas with reliable infrastructure.
To solve this I propose RefreshML - open source data science dashboard, powered by messaging and deployment infrastructure that makes managing machine learning models in production more flexible and provides tools for avoiding common pitfalls.</p>
<p>By treating ML model as a microservice, it's possible to apply best practices accumulated by software engineers.
This includes separation of clients requesting prediction from predictive models via a messaging system, which enables autoscaling models to meet the load and allows to perform A/B testing in relevant use cases, such as recommendation systems.
It also allows to detect dataset shift interactively, and maybe in future even detect adversarial attacks for deep learning models.</p>
<p>Data scientists have big problems to solve. As a community, we should help them with the right tools and best approaches, so ML projects will be safe, ethical and deliver value</p>
