<div><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote>Today I discovered Joel test, a test to evaluate software companies. While the article is pretty out-of-date, and there are some points that are exclusively for companies working on compiled programming languages, the article is still very interesting.</div><div>
</div><div>I think every software company should took the test. Also I think it can be useful for programmers, to evaluate if a company is a good place to work.</div><div>
</div><div>The original article is at:</div>[http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html)

<div>Let me provide a summary of original questions here:</div><div><blockquote></blockquote>- <li>Do you use source control?</li><li>Can you make a build in one step?</li><li>Do you make daily builds?</li><li>Do you have a bug database?</li><li>Do you fix bugs before writing new code?</li><li>Do you have an up-to-date schedule?</li><li>Do you have a spec?</li><li>Do programmers have a quiet working conditions?</li><li>Do you use the best tools money can buy?</li><li>Do you have testers?</li><li>Do new candidates write code during their interview?</li><li>Do you do hallway usability testing?</li>
</div><div>My personal update to the questions would be:</div><div>- <li>Do you use a distributed source control system?</li><li>Do you use a bug database where users can report bugs directly?</li><li>Do you have a testing protocol, and specific resources for testing?</li><li>Do you fix bugs before implementing new features?</li><li>Do you have automated build or deployment procedures?</li><li>Do you have a roadmap, and you don't make important changes to the short term priorities?</li><li>Does your team work in good conditions (quiet environment, flexible schedule, freedom to choose development software, fair paycheck...)</li>
<div>I think those questions can give you an idea on how efficient your company is, and indirectly, about the quality of your software.</div></div>
