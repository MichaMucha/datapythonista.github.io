I think LATEX is simply amazing by itself. More when writing an academic document, but for any kind of doc, using LATEX is really time and pain saving.

The concept of creating a document class (defining all the styles of the document), and then simply forgetting on formats, and focusing on content is just amazing. Also the automatic management of references (bibliography), the automatic management of figure and table labels, and and the automatic creation of the table of contents. Not to mention how nice is creating formulas.

But besides LATEX itself, what I found really cool is [www.sharelatex.com](http://www.sharelatex.com/). I've been using it for a while, and after discovering some new features (new for me, not sure how long they've been there), I found it was the perfect editor for LATEX.

First advantage is the cloud usual stuff, no local installation needed, backups are managed by the service provider, accessible from different devices...

But there are some other specific to the site:

- <li>Collaborative environment: see what others are writing in real time, conflict avoidance, always up-to-date, and even author chat</li><li>Version control system: Don't loose any version, history of changes is kept.</li><li>Ownership of your project: download a zip of all your files, sync to Dropbox, and also to Github (beta).</li><li>Extra features:</li><ul><li>Spell check</li><li>Autocomplete</li><li>And last but not least: VIM keybindings!!!</li>
</ul><div>Few of the features are for premium accounts only (+10 collaborators, Dropbox sync, full history access), but the free plan I'm using is exactly what I need so far.</div>
