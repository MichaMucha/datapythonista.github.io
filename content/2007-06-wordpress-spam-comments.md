Today I've installed a new [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) plugin, to avoid robots write comments on this page. It's very common that spammers use blog comments to link their pages, as publicity, and for increasing their pagerank.<br/><br/>It can be solved in WordPress using [JSSpamBlock](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jsspamblock/) plugin from [Paul Butler](http://www.paulbutler.org/). Thanks man!
