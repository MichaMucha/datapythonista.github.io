I often check Google Video for conferences about technologies, trends, or anything about IT. I like it more than just read books, articles or posts.<br/><br/>Today I've realized about [Google Video Lectures](http://code.google.com/edu/videolectures.html), a set of videos about many subjects (AJAX, Python, Clustering...), focused to IT educators, but very interesting for any IT geek.
