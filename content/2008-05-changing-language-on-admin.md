When working on multilanguage sites, a feature that many times I missed is a direct way to change the language when you're on the admin,<br/><br/>With standard Django the only way that exists (as far as I know), is leaving the admin, going to the website, change the language there, and come back to the admin. Not very fast.<br/><br/>Today, I've created a [snippet](http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/751/) that creates a drop down menu on the admin bar (just in the main page) to change the language.<br/><br/>Hope it helps.
