Kimmi supporters have waited long for it, but this evening (in Europe time), the unluckier Formula 1 pilot had a lucky strike and has won 2007 Formula 1 Worlds Championship.<br/><br/>I know that no pilot can be compared with Schummi, the best pilot of history, but Kimmi is a brilliant pilot that deserved this cup it for some years. Luckily, emotion is guaranteed for next yeasr, because another brilliant pilot has been quite close to Kimmi, Hamilton, and it's one of main candidates for next year. It was a sad day for him, but I'm sure that he'll be fighting for World Championship for many years.<br/><br/><strong>Congratulations Kimmi!!! </strong>
