Few days ago a new search engine was published, and many media covered the it. I supposed for that, that it should be something important, but I think that in few days it'll only be important for its creators. Why I think that? Well, here you have my arguments for that conclusion.<br/><br/>From [Cuil](http://www.cuil.com/info/): "Cuil searches more pages on the Web than anyone else—three times as many as Google and ten times as many as Microsoft."<br/><br/>From [Google](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/07/we-knew-web-was-big.html): "when our systems that process links on the web to find new content hit a milestone: 1 trillion (as in 1,000,000,000,000) unique URLs on the web at once!"<br/><br/>From myself:  1,000,000,000,000 * 3 = 3,000,000,000,000<br/><br/>From [Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main/vaig.be): "Vaig.be	has a  traffic rank of 1,163,358"<br/><br/><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  You're supposed to have 1 trillion pages, and you don't have my blog, that is the 1 million page more visited around the world? WTF!
