Some time ago I purchased a [Brother](http://www.brother.com/) multifunctional priner/scanner/fax, the [MFC-235C](http://www.brother.es/g3.cfm/s_page/67210/s_level/32130/s_product/MFC235CT1).<br/><br/>Today, after reinstalling my laptop, I had to install it again, and it has been as easy as the first. Specially because Brother has GNU (aka Linux) support, including GPL drivers for all printer features.<br/><br/>As well as the deserved publicity that I want to give to Brother in this post, I want to write a quick installation howto. I'm installing the printer locally using USB, and CUPS in my Debian. You should have this installed in your computer before starting the next steps (otherwise you'll have to add some steps, or change some).<br/>- <br/>	<li>apt-get install lpr</li><br/>	<li>Download lpr driver from [http://solutions.brother.com/linux/sol/printer/linux/lpr_drivers.html](http://solutions.brother.com/linux/sol/printer/linux/lpr_drivers.html)</li><br/>	<li>dpkg -i <downloaded driver></li><br/>	<li>Download cups driver from [http://solutions.brother.com/linux/sol/printer/linux/cups_drivers.html](http://solutions.brother.com/linux/sol/printer/linux/cups_drivers.html)</li><br/>	<li>dpkg -i <downloaded driver></li><br/>	<li>Go to the [FAQ](http://solutions.brother.com/linux/sol/printer/linux/linux_faq-2.html) if you have any problem</li><br/>	<li>Download scanner sane driver from [http://solutions.brother.com/linux/sol/printer/linux/sane_drivers.html](http://solutions.brother.com/linux/sol/printer/linux/sane_drivers.html)</li><br/>	<li>dpkg -i <downloaded driver></li><br/>	<li>Got to the scanner [FAQ](http://solutions.brother.com/linux/sol/printer/linux/linux_faq.html) if you have any problem (it's common having problems running sane with a standard user, but information on how to fix it is available at this FAQ).</li><br/>
<br/>And that's it! Very easy compared with the problems that I had doing the same installation for HP all-in-one printers.
