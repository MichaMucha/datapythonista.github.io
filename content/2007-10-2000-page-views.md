Today, this blog has reached page view number 2.000. This blog had some testing sample versions, but started in a serious way on February 24th, 2007 (8 months ago).<br/><br/>In this time, probably nothing very interesting has been published here, you know; but when some months ago I started using and hacking Django, I started writing many posts about it, and that created many visits interested in my hacks, tips...<br/><br/>I don't know what will happen in the future, if visits will increase, or if I'll have more interesting stuff to tell; but all what I can say is that I'm so happy having my voice in the Internet, for those who want to listen to me.
