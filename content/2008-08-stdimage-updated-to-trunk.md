Everything is changing on Django those days, and many people contacted me because StdImage stopped working with trunk.<br/><br/>Basically all major changes (except GeoDjango) affected it, such as change from newforms to forms, signal refactoring, and file storage refactoring. Now it's up to date.<br/><br/>Remind that [django-stdimage](http://code.google.com/p/django-stdimage/) is a Django application that provides a standardizedÂ  image field(standard name including row id, standard size, and ability to create automatic thumbnails, also standarized of course).
