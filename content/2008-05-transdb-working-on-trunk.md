Some days ago, after the merge of qs-rf to trunk, model field i18n was in trouble, so the principal package for this approach (django-multilingual) stopped working for the latest version of trunk.<br/><br/>This weekend we had a TransDb sprint, to try to improve our project, and contribute to fix this situation in any way.<br/><br/>The result: We fixed many issues on TransDb, now the project has a more conventional structure, and a setup script, and... <strong>TransDb is now working on trunk!</strong><br/><br/>For achieving  it we created a new branch called oldforms.<br/><br/>[Try it now](http://code.google.com/p/transdb)!
