[Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) is a very powerful and very well done Web framework, but some things are missing - in my opinion -.<br/><ol><br/>	<li>Specific way to allow saving multilingual texts on database.</li><br/>	<li>Reporting system.</li><br/>	<li>Another edit_inline mode, with a delete button, and an edit button that links to the item page.</li><br/>	<li>Improve database synchronization and make it create fields in existing tables.</li><br/>	<li>Allow storing files in database</li><br/></ol><br/>I hope having enough time for contributing to it. Thanks to Django team for that great work!
