Some months ago Google announced that they were working to add presentations to its Google Applications suite. And today finally they finished their work, some hours ago Google announced it in [Official Google Blog](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/our-feature-presentation.html).<br/><br/>You can check how it works [here](http://docs.google.com/).<br/><br/>My first impressions: I miss the feature for importing Openoffice.org documents, and it looks that it's not possible to create your own theme. I hope that they add those features (and more) in new releases.
