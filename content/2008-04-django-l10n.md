This Sunday, I participated in [This Week in Django](http://blog.michaeltrier.com/2008/4/28/this-week-in-django-20-2008-04-27), and tried to give some ideas on Django localization.<br/><br/>Here I'll post some of the ideas of the interview (and some that I missed), for serving as reference:<br/><br/><strong>How to translate your application (quick guide):</strong><br/>- <br/>	<li>Mark every text in your application for translation:<br/><ul><br/>	<li>In models.py, views.py... convert  <em>'my text in just one language'</em> to <em>_('my text to translate')</em>. Don't forget to import _: f<em>rom django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _</em></li><br/>	<li>In templates, convert <em><p>Text in english</p></em> to <em><p>{% trans 'Text in many languages' %}</p></em> (also this can be done with blocktrans tag)</li><br/>
<br/></li><br/>	<li>Go to your project path and create a directory called locale (also you can do that just for an application)</li><br/>	<li>Execute ${PATH_TO_DJANGO}/bin/make-messages -l ${LANGUAGE_CODE} (where language code is en for english, es for spanish...)</li><br/>	<li>Edit ${PROJECT_PATH}/locale/${LANGUAGE_CODE}/LC_MESSAGES/django.po and set the <em>msgstr</em> variables with the translation of every <em>msgid</em></li><br/>	<li>Run msgfmt django.po -o django.mo (I just realized after the interview that exists a django script complie-messages.py that does that for all .po files)</li><br/>	<li>And then you have your application translated. There are some settings in settings.py that need to be set for making it work (USE_I18N = True, set LANGUAGES and LANGUAGE_CODE, and specify the django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware middleware)</li><br/>	<li>Then probably you'll want to have your select input with all available languages (or something like that). For it you'll have to add <em>(r'^i18n/', include('django.conf.urls.i18n'))</em> to your urls.py, and from your html send a POST request to <em>/i18n/setlang</em> with the parameter <em>language</em> set to desired language code</li><br/>	<li>For more stuff, and detailed information check: [http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/i18n/](http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/i18n/)</li><br/></ul><br/><strong>Things that IMHO should be improved in Django for a better L10n expirience:</strong><br/>- <br/>	<li>Move localflavors outside trunk (to avoid unnecessary translation costs). Every localflavor should come with necessary translations.</li><br/>	<li>Create locale settings (besides translations), to set decimal symbol, date and time format, first day of week... and use it automatically for current locale/language.<br/><ul><br/>	<li>Check tickets [#1061](http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/1061), [#3940](http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/3940) and [#6783](http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/6783) that gives different approaches to this problem.</li><br/>
<br/></li><br/>	<li>Create translatable CharFields and TextFields. For now [django-multilingual](http://code.google.com/p/django-multilingual/) and [transdb](http://code.google.com/p/transdb/) can be used for it.</li><br/>	<li>Adding something to select the language in admin (when more than one is available).</li><br/>	<li>Haven't checked it too much, but it'll be good if urls could be translated as well.</li><br/></ul><br/>Finally I want to thank for letting me participate in TWID to [Michael Trier](http://blog.michaeltrier.com), who is a father, husband, software architect, entrepreneur, a great journalist, and a better person. And also to [Malcolm Tredinnick](http://www.pointy-stick.com/blog/), who recommended me to the show (not sure if I deserved the honour), and for his unpayable help and support on my Django work.
