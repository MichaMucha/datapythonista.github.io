Browsing the internet I've found an interesting initiative, some kind of enterpreneurs event for people in Barcelona area. I can imagine that it'll be focused on IT, but just guessing, so there is just few information right now.<br/><br/>It'll be on September 12th at 19:30, place TBD in Barcelona.<br/><br/>You can check and join the event at its [blog](http://www.sachafuentes.com/) and its [wiki](http://www.sachafuentes.com/wiki).
