Blog moved
##########

It's been a while since I wanted to move my blog out of blogger.

Today I finally did it. :)

.. code-block:: python

    print('hello world')

This new blog is uses Pelican hosted on GitHub pages. Which will
let me create blog posts by simply using restructuredText, or
Jupyter notebooks.
