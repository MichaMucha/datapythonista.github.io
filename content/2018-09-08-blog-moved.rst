Blog moved
##########

It's been a while since I wanted to move my blog out of blogger.

Today I finally did it. :)

.. code-block:: python

    print('hello world (from Pelican)')

This new blog uses Pelican, and is hosted on GitHub pages. Which will
let me create blog posts by simply using restructuredText, or
Jupyter notebooks.

You can check the source code here: https://github.com/datapythonista/datapythonista.github.io
