Today I've created my own code for having (in Django) fields in more than one language stored in database. There were some other packages, but none of them useful for me (as commented [here](http://vaig.be/2007/07/11/django-database-texts-translated/)).<br/><br/>TransDb's main goal is that is simple, for application users, application programmers, and the code itself. Some work is still missing, but there is a working version at [TransDb Google Code page](http://code.google.com/p/transdb/).<br/><br/>Any comment will be appreciate.
