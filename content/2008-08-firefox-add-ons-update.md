Some time ago, I wrote[ a post](http://vaig.be/2007/04/25/firefox-extensions/) in this blog about the essential Firefox extensions for developers. After some time, that post is out of date, so I changed some of those extensions, and started using some new. Here is the updated list:<br/><br/>[Firebug](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843): Javascript debugging, graphical check of CSS properties (moving the cursor to an area of the web, you can see the html, css properties...), loading time statistics per file, and a infinite set of option.<br/><br/>[Web developer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60): Disabling CSS, Javascript, Resizing browser window to standard formats...<br/><br/>[HTML Validator](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/249): Offline version fo the w3c validator.<br/><br/>[SearchStatus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/321): PageRank, and Alexa rank information.
