While there are some cool things in Gnome 3, I think mostly everyone will agree that there are many design mistakes. To me, it looks like a bad copy of the Mac desktop, and it's specially annoying that they also brought the "let Steve Jobs decide it for you" philosophy to GNU. I don't really know who is leading the project, but looks like they should send a resume to Apple.

Anyway, the reason for this post is that I realized that I'm not alone. And I realized in a strange way... Basically, it looks to be a consensus on which are the parts of Gnome 3 which suck more, and I arrived to this conclusion after seeing that there is a Fedora package to remove almost every non-sense feature Gnome brings.

These include (among others):

- <li>Accessibility icon always on the bar</li><li>Alt-tab bothering system of grouping windows</li><li>Power off option not hidden by secret methods</li>


I'm not a genius, so I don't usually share my opinions in Linus Torvalds style, but I think it's totally worth in this case.

So, if you're using Gnome 3, you should probably check this link out:
