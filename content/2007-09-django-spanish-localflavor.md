Django sprint has finished, but not Django work. Today I've written some lines of code for adding some new features on Django. In this case, I've programmed a validation function for spanish NIF identification number. I've also created a couple of files with useful spanish data (regions and provinces in Spain).<br/><br/>The spanish localflavor package was created some months ago, but not yet submitted to subversion. I hope with this contribution (and more that I'm going to do) we can finish it soon.<br/><br/>You can check a detailed status on this [ticket](http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/4036).
