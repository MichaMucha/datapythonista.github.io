A new Django community has been created for Django users/developers that speak Catalan, or live in Catalonia.

Main reasons for its creation are:
<ul>
<li>Provide a resource where Catalan users can ask django questions in their own language.</li>
<li>Coordinate Django Catalan specific jobs, mostly Catalan translation (that now is up to date).</li>
<li>Be in touch with other Django community members in our little country (for business, beers...).</li>
</ul>
