One of the key websites about Django is [Django Snippets](http://www.djangosnippets.org), by one of the key Django developers, [James Bennett](http://www.b-list.org/).<br/><br/>I've followed many of the James work, and it's awesome; but I've a complaint on Django Snippets. It's the inefficient way to find anything there. The only ways that I've found is searching using a paginated list by author, language or tag (sorted alphabetically), where you can spend a huge amount of time if the tag you search starts by Z.<br/><br/>Of course that I can go to Google an search using site:www.djangosnippets.org, and it would work for all indexed snippets, but I think that at least this search box should be added on the site (until anybody writes the [generic search engine](http://www.djangosnippets.org/about/faq/) for Django).  It would also help adding result page numbers (with links) at the end of the paginated list.
